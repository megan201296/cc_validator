# Credit Card Validator
This is a simple bash script that checks a series of numbers and sees if it satistfies the Luhn's Algorithm (which is used for credit card validation). Right now it only takes user input. Future plans include reading from files and determining CC type (MasterCard, Visa, etc.). Feel free to contribute if you want to.
